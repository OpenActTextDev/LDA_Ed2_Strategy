# Loss Data Analytics - Edition Two {-}

<p style="text-align:right;">
*Date: `r format(Sys.Date(), "%d %B %Y")`*</p>



The first edition of *Loss Data Analytics* was completed in August 2018; some might say that the development was organic. We managed to get 19 authors from 8 countries in more or less in the same direction; the product is a free online book that was written in "R" and is hosted on Github. 

In revising the book for the second edition, we now have the advantage of seeing the book in its entirety. We can use this base to promote cooperation and consistency among chapters. We did well with consistency of notation in the first edition but can now think strategically about how to develop topics within the book and how to make them accessible for different readerships.




## Steering Committee Members {-}

The project goal is to have the actuarial community author our learning resources in a collaborative fashion. The following contributors have taken a leadership role in developing this strategy to guid the development of the second edition of $Loss$ $Data$ $Analytics$.
