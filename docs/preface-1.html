<h2>Why Loss Data Analytics?<a href="preface-1.html#why-loss-data-analytics" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<p>The intent is that this type of short course will eventually permeate throughout the actuarial curriculum. Given the dramatic changes in the way that actuaries treat data, analysis of loss data seems like a natural place to start. The idea behind the name <strong>loss data analytics</strong> is to integrate classical loss data models from applied probability with modern analytic tools. In particular, we recognize that big data (including social media and usage based insurance) are here to stay and that high speed computation is readily available.</p>

<div id="resources" class="section level2 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h2>Resources<a href="preface-1.html#resources" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<ul>
<li>This tutorial is based on the first five chapters of the <strong>open and freely available book</strong> <a href="https://openacttexts.github.io/">Loss Data Analytics</a>.
<ul>
<li>As the name suggests, <a href="https://openacttexts.github.io/LDARcode/">R for Loss Data Analytics</a> provides sample <code>R</code> code for the book, although not needed for this tutorial.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>As described in how to navigate this tutorial below, you will not need to download any data for this course. However, if you want to have the data to follow up, we generally make it available through buttons such as:
<ul>
<li><button download>
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OpenActTexts/LDACourse1/main/Data/PropertyFundInsample.csv">View the Property Fund Data as a .csv file.</a>
</button>
Then, do a “Save Page as” if you wish to download.</li>
<li>Alternatively, go directly to the <a href="https://github.com/OpenActTexts/LDACourse1/tree/main/Data">Github page</a> to access the data.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>For advanced data applications in insurance, you may be interested in the series <a href="http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/statistics-probability/statistics-econometrics-finance-and-insurance/predictive-modeling-applications-actuarial-science-volume-1">Predictive Modeling Applications in Actuarial Science</a>. Although the books are not free, for many of the chapters you will find the data and sample <code>R</code> code <a href="https://instruction.bus.wisc.edu/jfrees/jfreesbooks/PredictiveModelingVol1/index.htm">freely available</a>.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="how-to-navigate-this-tutorial" class="section level2 unnumbered hasAnchor">
<h2>How to Navigate this Tutorial<a href="preface-1.html#how-to-navigate-this-tutorial" class="anchor-section" aria-label="Anchor link to header"></a></h2>
<ul>
<li>This online tutorial is designed to guide you through the foundations of modeling loss data.</li>
<li>The anticipated completion time is approximately ten hours.</li>
<li>The tutorial assumes that you are familiar with the foundations in the statistical software <code>R</code>, such as Datacamp’s <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r%20">Introduction to R</a> or Codecademy’s <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-r">Learn R</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Role of Video Introductions.</strong> There are five chapters in this tutorial that summarize the foundations. Each chapter is subdivided into several sections. At the beginning of each section is a short video, typically 5-10 minutes, that summarizes the section key learning outcomes. Following the video, you can see more details about the underlying <code>R</code> code for the analysis presented in the video.</p>
<p><strong>Role of Exercises.</strong> Following each video introduction, there are one or two exercises that allow you to practice skills to make sure that you fully grasp the learning outcomes. The exercises are implemented using an online learning platform provided by <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/">Datacamp</a> so that you need not install <code>R</code>. Feedback is programmed into the exercises so that you will learn a lot by making mistakes! You will be pacing yourself, so always feel free to reveal the answers by hitting the <code>Solution</code> tab. Remember, going through quickly is not equivalent to learning deeply. Use this tool to enhance your understanding of one of the foundations of data science.</p>

<p><strong>A Few More Tips</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>For the videos, with this player you hit the <strong>CC</strong> button and then <em>English</em> to see closed captions. You can also experiment with the speed of the video (the <em>1x</em> symbol) and other standard video player features.</li>
<li>When completing the tutorial exercises, replace the question marks <strong>??</strong> by the appropriate code (in earlier versions, we used underscores).</li>
<li>The graphical displays upon completion of the tutorial exercises appear only in the narrow window of the code and do not look good. This is a limitation of the <em>Datacamp</em> platform. For a more professional looking graph, in many cases you can simply copy the code and paste it into your own version of <code>R</code> to enhance its appearance. However, be careful with this approach. Sometimes, as part of the background, we pre-load data and libraries that you don’t see unless you dig down. (How to do this? Go to our <a href="https://github.com/OpenActTextDev/LDACourse1/">Github site</a>!)</li>
<li>When a tutorial exercise finishes with a graph, the (green) success message is obscured. To see it, after completing the exercise, hit the “R-Console” button at the top. Then re-size the html page and immediately revert back to the full page mode. This procedure allows you to view the message.</li>
<li><strong>Devices and Browsers</strong>. We tested the course on popular devices and browers. Our videos and tutorial exercises seemed to behave well on all the devices we looked at, including cell phones, Ipads, Apple and PC laptop/desktops. Most problematic is the .pdf overheads. These don’t seem to work well at all on cell phones and Ipads. For Apple and PC laptop/desktops:
<ul>
<li>When you view the .pdf output for the overheads with the browser FireFox, the default is for the table of contents to appear. The fix for this is to click the icon in the upper left-hand corner.</li>
<li>For other browsers we tested (Edge and Chrome), the page of the .pdf that you select on appears the first time. You can either refresh every time you select a new page or, an easier route, scroll down to the appropriate page to see the desired output.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Let us know about other bugs you encounter. We may not be able to address them but at least we can add notes here to warn other users.<br />
</li>
<li>Some of the exercises are more challenging and you may wish to skip them on your first pass through the course. These are indicated with this symbol:
